# WireframeGUI
A simple tool that can place GUI elements of a wireframe onto a screen and manipulate them. Created for EECS 293: Software Craftsmanship at Case Western Reserve University.

# About
WireframeGUI was the final project in Software Craftsmanship, a class that revolved around core concepts in writing good code and using good coding practices. The main topics covered in the class included Unit Testing, Documentation, Debugging and Error Handling, Complexity of Functions, and other topics revolving around writing readable, straightforward code. 

This porject focused on creating a hierarchical class structure for various objects that relate to each other, and including polymorphism where applicable with super and subclasses. The creation of an actual GUI to show the program was extra credit, and I hastily created a GUI towards the end of the semester. The main focus, however, is on the class structure itself.

This class was the first time I had worked with Scala, and found the experience pretty enjoyable, especially when working with tools like SBT, ScalaTest, and Scoverage, as they made unit testing with 100% coverage a much more easily attainable goal. SBT made it incredibly easy to generate documentation for the class structure.
